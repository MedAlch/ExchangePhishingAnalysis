# ExchangePhishingAnalysis
A simple set of tools to investigate phishing incidents through Exchange using Powershell.

At the moment the only tool available is ExchangePhishingAnalysis.ps1, aiming to provide a quick way to get a report of all the targets of a phishing campaign without using the HORRIBLE, VERY SLOW, HORRENDOUS Exchange interface.

The script is still in building phase and lacks a lot of documentation. I'll be back.

ExchangePhishingAnalysis.ps1 requires and administrative account on your Exchange tenant, as well as the Exchange Online Powershell module. See here how to install it : https://365tips.be/fr/installez-le-nouveau-module-exchange-online-powershell-v2/
